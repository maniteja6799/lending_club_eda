# Lending Club Case Study

We are given the loans data from consumer finance company which provide the information attributes about historical and current loans.

We are required to apply exploratory data analysis learnings and activities to cleanse and analyze the data to derive the insights from this dataset.

Our focus would be mostly on analyzing the risk of loans going bad (i.e. default) and corroborate or correct the conventional understanding about some financial data.

The preformatted notebook would be available on the [project page](https://maniteja6799.github.io/lending_club_eda/Pawan_Mani_Teja_Kuppili.html)

## General Information 

This project is to apply EDA techniques to the provided loan data to find out various parameters which could affect the loans to go default.

Following data cleanup applied before the analysis,

    - Data Cleanup and Conversion
    - Derived Metrics
    - Outliers Removal
    - Data Analysis 
  
The analysis is mainly focused on the probability of loan is going default, and derive interesting insights on, borrower’s credit history, loan terms, loan amounts vs borrower incomes and their locations.

It also surprised us and challenged some of our perceptions (e.g. verified loans would be more secure than unverified)

- Lending Club Loans dataset.
  
  We received the loans dataset availale on github repo at [loans.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maniteja6799/lending_club_eda/master/loan.csv)

## Conclusions
- Probability of loan defaults based on the US states residents
- Impact of Loan verification status
- Probability of loan defaults based on borrowers’ delinquency data
- Impact of loan term on payback probability
- Impact of amount of principal received on loan turning default.
- Impact of DTI and monthly income
- Borrowers’ credit history and interesting finding on generational gap.
